HOW TO USE

There are two users hard coded into this site: the seller, and the customer.

The seller is capable of uploading pictures, and viewing whether or not the customer has approved these pictures.
Both users can make comments. Only the customer can approve or reject images. Bring an image into view by clicking on it to reject/approve it.
You cannot approve/reject pictures once they have been decided on. 

FEATURES MISSING

Styling - I only spent a few minutes cleaning this up but this was some messy styling just to make it look somewhat presentable

Deleting images - I didn't get to this but it isn't the end of the world without this feature, although there is a limit of 6 pictures in total that can't be changed as of right now.



Other than that, please enjoy uploading random pictures and adding comments to this. I'd love to add some more to make this like a mini social media web-app.
